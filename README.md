# TicTacToeSimpli

- 4x4 tic tac toe board on the screen
- a start button that clears the current board and restarts the game
- alternating X and O turns where you touch the square to fill it in
- a win indicator that shows a win that matches one of the following: 4 in row (vertical/horizontal/diagonal) , 4 corners, or a 2x2 box. 
- when determining if a player has won, write the algorithm in such that you could support a board with more than 4x4 rows / cols.  2x2 box and 4 corners should remain the same.  The UI does not have to support this.

- win indicator also shows the way youve won, and supports scenarios of winning multiple different ways with 1 move
- show winning move location
